Selfnutri – Cloud Computing Final Project (MSIT-3470)The final, live application is accessible here: https://d3tuac21giuzpq.cloudfront.net/Table of Contents1) Project Overview & Features2) Architecture & Technical Decisions3) API Details (Write & Read Paths)4) SLO & Monitoring Plan5) Deployment & Run Instructions6) Team, Roles, and AI Usage1) Project Overview & FeaturesSelfnutri is a lightweight personal health and nutrition tracker that lets users quickly log daily meals and water intake, then review their history and progress over time. The goal is to demonstrate a secure, serverless cloud architecture with real write/read paths.Core Feature (Write Path): Users submit a new entry via the frontend, which calls a POST /logs API to write a document into a managed Firestore database.Analytics Feature (Read Path): Users view history powered by a GET /logs API that queries Firestore and returns the results to the UI.2) Architecture & Technical DecisionsThe application uses a hybrid serverless design: AWS provides static hosting, CDN, and API execution, while Google Cloud Firestore is used as the managed NoSQL database.Architecture DiagramCore Cloud ComponentsLayerComponent(s)Resource DetailFrontend DeliveryAWS CloudFront (CDN)URL: https://d3tuac21giuzpq.cloudfront.net/Frontend HostingAWS S3 (Static Hosting)Static HTML/CSS/JS is stored in an S3 bucket.Backend APIAWS API Gateway + LambdaAPI Gateway calls an AWS Lambda function which executes business logic.Data PersistenceGoogle Firestore (Managed NoSQL)Stores meal and water logs as documents.Object StorageAWS S3 (Data Bucket)Provisioned for future use cases like file/image uploads.Security & Operational FocusCloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC): Enabled to ensure the frontend S3 bucket only allows access from the CloudFront distribution, blocking direct S3 public access.Least-Privilege & Secrets: Lambda and CI/CD use dedicated IAM roles, and all secrets (Firebase credentials, API keys) are injected via environment variables.3) API Details (Write & Read Paths)The backend exposes a minimal, focused API to prove the cloud stack end-to-end.PathMethodDescriptionData Operation/logsPOSTAccepts JSON payloads for new logs (meal/water entries) and writes a new document to Firestore.Write to Firestore/logsGETReturns all existing logs by reading from Firestore and sending an aggregated JSON list back to the client.Query FirestoreExample API RequestsBash# Create a new log (Write Path)
curl -X POST https://l38jxggdfh.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/logs ...

# Fetch all logs (Read Path)
curl https://l38jxggdfh.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/logs
4) SLO & Monitoring PlanMonitoring focuses on latency, reliability, and database health using AWS CloudWatch and Firestore monitoring tools.SLOTargetInstrumentationRationaleAPI Latency (p95)< 400 msAPI Gateway and Lambda metrics in CloudWatch.Targets acceptable user experience.Database Latency (p99)< 150 msFirestore/Firebase performance dashboards.Targets high database health.Error Rate< 2% over 5 minCloudWatch alarms on 4xx/5xx and Lambda error metrics.Targets service availability.5) Deployment & Run InstructionsDeployment is designed to be simple but realistic for a solo project.Required ToolsNode.js/npm (Required for dependencies).AWS CLI (Required for deployment).Python 3 (Optional for local development server).Cloud Deployment (Deploy)Frontend: Static files are uploaded to the S3 frontend bucket, then a CloudFront invalidation is issued to push the new version globally.Backend: Lambda code is packaged and deployed, then wired to the /logs routes in API Gateway; environment variables are configured for Firestore access.Local Development (Run)The frontend can be served locally while still pointing to the deployed API for quick UI iteration:Bash# From the project root, ensure you have Python 3 installed
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
# Open in browser: http://localhost:8000
6) Team, Roles, and AI UsageTeam & RolesNameRole / ContributionRaja Rajeswari Naga Pravallika ChilukuruSole Developer: Architecture, Frontend, Backend, AWS/Firebase Integration, and Documentation.AI UsageToolHow UsedHuman Review / NotesChatGPT / GeminiScaffolded boilerplate code, suggested architecture options, and helped draft documentation templates.All IAM policies, secrets handling, and final logic were manually reviewed and corrected for security and correctness.
